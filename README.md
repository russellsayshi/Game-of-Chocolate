# Game-of-Chocolate
In the chocolate game, there is an imaginary bar of chocolate with x number of pieces (chosen by user at start). Each player then takes turns and can remove 1-n (also chosen by user) pieces from the bar of chocolate. The goal is to be the player who gets the last piece.

For beginning players, it is recommended to start with 21 for x and 4 for n. Try and figure out how the game works without looking at the code!

## Instructions
Compile all of the `.c` files, and run as you would normally.
